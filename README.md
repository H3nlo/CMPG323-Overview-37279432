# CMPG323-Overview-37279432
This repository is an overview of all the requirements for my next projects. It will outline all of the desired features, functionalities (how the system should function and perform) and user expectations.
It neatly shows when it is reccomended to start with a part of the project and when the whole project should be done and handed in.


 Here follows the reposotories of the next projects;
 
1. CMPG323-Project2-37279432 - Creating a CRUD RESTful API that connects to a database to manage logistics data, enabling operations such as retrieval, creation, updating, and deletion of resources via HTTP endpoints.

2. CMPG323-Project3-37279432 - This project involves working on an existing ASP.NET Core MVC Web Application, where the task is to enhance and improve the application. This includes focusing on architectural patterns, implementing coding principles, and utilizing design patterns as required for the project.

3. CMPG323-Project4-37279432 - This project introduces Robotic Process Automation (RPA) as a technology that automates repetitive tasks, particularly in UI (User Interface) automation, allowing testers to automate the testing process for web applications, to achieve more efficient and accurate results.

4. CMPG323-Project5-37279432 - This project is about creating a Power BI report that visualizes and monitors orders and product sales, ensuring stakeholders have access to the same information related to customer status and orders.

My branching strategy will consiste of of the following;
Main Branch - This branch will only have the stable and fully-tested project.
Development Branch - Is for ongoing development in the project.
Hotfix Branch - Is used to quickly fix and address issues.


The .gitignore file will be situated in the repositories for evey project. I will use the .gitignore file to prevent any sensitive data to be released, files that comes with specific IDE's, log files, temporary files, executable files and compiled binaries.


Don't store your sensitive information in the code, were it will be accesed by anyone who is a member of the repository. You can also use .gitignore to exclude any specific files which insures that you never commit sensitive information on accident. You can also use incrypted files to store sensitive data and then be able to commit it to the repository. The last one is to have protocols that everyone should follow recarding sharing and storing sensitive data.
